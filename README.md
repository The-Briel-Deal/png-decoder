A (probably non-compliant) png decoder.

This is just used as a learning excercise for me to understand the spec at https://www.w3.org/TR/png.

DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING. PROBABLY NOT EVEN A REFERENCE. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.

this is mit licensed so actually you can use it for whatever you want, but it probably won't work like you want lol.
